  "transcript": "Ten-year-old Jomah was waiting for his mother to pick him up from school when the missile hit. My head hurts so much he tells me. And I don't know what happened to my friends. His UN school happens to be next to a police station and the strike hit at precisely the time children were going home. Mohammed is a police officer. On Saturday morning a missile hit the station he was working at. I told him Israel says they're targeting Hamas' security apparatus. The police force is not political. It's an institution for the people. Androja is a doctor. She was working at her clinic when an airstrike hit the police station next door. Androja has three children. The direct result of Israel's so-called targeted strikes. Doctors say it's unlikely she'll ever see them again. We saw civilian casualties of what Israel calls its war on Hamas. And spoke to those whose lives will never be the same again because of Israel's decision to dismantle Hamas by destroying Gaza. The day of continuous Israeli bombardment have also taken their toll on the strips already poor infrastructure. From the rubble that was once a mosque that happened to be by a police station, to the school hit as Israel targeted another building nearby. While we were sleeping, I heard a loud thud at the mosque next door. We were so afraid and look what happened to my son. At least we are alive. Seven of us were sleeping in a room when we heard the explosion. The walls collapsed around us. It took two hours to get help by my sisters. It took two hours to get help from my sisters. It took two hours to get help from my sisters. It took two hours to get help from my sisters. How many more lives that will take? Shireen Tadrose, Al Jazeera, Gaza.",
